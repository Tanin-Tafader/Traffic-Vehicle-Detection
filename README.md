Real-Time Traffic Video Analytics System
Overview

This project is a real-time traffic video analytics system designed to detect and count vehicles from traffic-intersection footage using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system processes video streams frame-by-frame, performs object detection, and aggregates results to analyze traffic activity and model performance.

The project focuses on evaluating speed–accuracy trade-offs for real-time deployment scenarios, such as intelligent transportation systems and traffic monitoring.

Features

Real-time vehicle detection and counting from video input

Frame-by-frame video processing pipeline

Support for common vehicle classes (e.g., car, truck, bus, motorcycle)

Performance evaluation using FPS, detection accuracy, and processing time

Modular design for easy experimentation and extension
